React is a library to create user interfaces. User interfaces are created with the help of _components_. You can treat components as reusable custom html.

In this hello world project, we create a component named `Greeting`. Greeting component will display a greeting inside HTML `h1` tag.

The html file add reference to 2 react files. `react.js` has the logic to create react components. `react-dom.js` inserts the react component to DOM.
